# covid-detection-using-fcgr
A system that identifies COVID-19 from other viral genomic sequences using FCGR generation.

Used the genomic sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to analyse Covid-19 in order to better understand the bioinformatics side of the worldwide pandemic-causing virus. 

Used 3 datasets - 100 Rows of only COVID +ve cases, 581 non COVID cases and 300 Sars-COV2 samples.

Created Frequency Chaos Game Representations (FCGR) of SARS-CoV-2 and other virus genome sequences. Following that, a CNN model was trained  to determine whether a given FCGR was caused by SARS-CoV-2 or not.
